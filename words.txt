Hey there! 
I need your help with something.
I have a text file that needs a bit of tweaking.
It's a paragraph with 10 sentences
each containing 2 to 5 words. 
Oh, and each sentence should be separated by a newline character. 
I want it to sound conversational, you know? 
Can you assist me with this? 
Thanks in advance!
